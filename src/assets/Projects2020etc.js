        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>We present ARBlockbot, an educational robotics and programming app for Android and iOS devices, geared towards primary and middle school students. Robotics education often requires heavy reliance on hardware, which can pose challenges to schools without necessary funding or storage space, or students who live further away from school. Furthermore, hardware setup and debugging is often strenuous, making rapid prototyping difficult. ARBlockbot eliminates the need for a physical robot or any hardware equipment and allows the virtual robot, which can be programmed using coding blocks, to interact with real-world objects and surfaces without the aid of AR markers.</p>

      <Figure path="./img/rehack-cover.png" alt="Banner with a white background and isometric graphics of people conversing around the blue-and-teal gradient Rehack logo." />

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I went a few hackathons early on in college and had lots of fun. However, I noticed the following issues with the conventional hackathon model, which I've grouped into 3 main areas:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Lack of interdisciplinary collaboration: </strong>it's not surprising that hackathon attendance is typically dominated by computer science and other technical STEM majors, but the main problem lies in the high barrier of active participation by non-technical students. Since the final product is almost always comprised of code, successful projects are built with heavy code contributions from (hopefuly) all team members. It then naturally follows that those with less technical skills have less capability to fully express their ideas at a hackathon. When I held workshops that took place soon after "hacking time" started, it was easy to see that less technically adept teams struggled to find a solid starting point, even with a fantastic idea, while other teams can just hit the ground running (some even come with pre-prepared code!). Real-world software is best developed through collaboration between diverse stakeholders, technical and non-technical, but that's certainly not what I saw at hackathons.</p>

      <p><strong>Health: </strong>hackathons are, for the most part, not the healthiest events. Hackers are sitting in front of the computer, moving very little, and coding most of the time. For overnight hackathons, staying up late into the night, or even not sleeping at all, to get as much work done on the project as possible is often glorified. It doesnâ€™t help that frequent sponsors for snacks and drinks include Red Bull, Monster, and Awake (caffeine-packed chocolate), among others. Is there a healthier approach we can take that still incorporates a fun learning experience and engagement with technology?</p>

      <p><strong>Process: </strong>hackathons are intended to foster technological innovation. The highest-level, selective hackathons may consistently generate original and well-executed ideas. However, this is not always the case with other hackathons, especially collegiate ones. Many teams struggle to come up with a truly original idea, and/or cannot execute their novel idea due to time or technical constraints and end up copying other existing projects. While remaking something may be a good learning experience, the opportunity for innovation is lost. Additionally from my observations, few teams continue working on their project after a hackathon: so many hackers push hard to write lots of code, only to leave it untouched after the event. It just felt like kind of a pity.</p>

      <h3>A Reverse Hackathon</h3>
      <p>Rehack was born out of the desire bring together students with different backgrounds and experiences to develop creative solutions that would make modern consumer tech products more fair, humane, and socially responsible. Rehack's mission is to empower students to critially examine technology around them and articulate their thoughts by prototyping solutions to the problems they see. I got together a small team of 10, and after a year of hard work, productive conversations, and non-stop fundraising, we launched the first student reverse hackathon.</p>

      <p>There are countless components involved in making Rehack successful both as an organization and as an event, but I want to touch on a particular component that I focused on heavily since the very beginning: the visual identity.</p>

      <h3>Constructing Rehack's Visual Identity</h3>
      <p>I started by reflecting on the intent and goals behind Rehack and where exactly I wanted to take it. I experimented with logomarks, logotypes, and a combination of the two. I also played around with different graphical forms, particularly one of the brain because it embodies two of Rehack's main values (mindfulness and innovation) and is widely recognizable. I also tried to incorporate "reverse" meaningfully, as that was one of Rehack's unique points. The initial work was all done in black and white to make an isolated decision on form. Early efforts can be seen in the initial Illustrator planning document.</p>

      <Figure path="./img/rehack-0.png"/>

      <p>After finalizing the logo's form, I coloured it with a blue-teal gradient in an attempt to convey the mentality change Rehack hopes to establish in student tech events. Since gradients can be difficut to work with graphically, especially when superimposed on top of various backgrounds, I also created monochrome variants of the logo. From the colours of the logo, I derived the colour palette, using 3 colours (including the blue and teal) as primary colours and variations of those as the supplementary colours. I also established four monochrome shades that are handy for grayscale designs and typography.</p>

      <Figure path="./img/rehack-5.png"/>
      <Figure path="./img/rehack-6.png" caption="Primary, supplementary, and monochrome colours."/>

      <p>For typography, I chose Nunito Sans to typeset the logo as well as to use in all paragraph and body texts. It's a precise geometric sans serif that I thought was lively and friendly but also nods to the logical, rational side of technology. It's also open source so it's accessible to future designers. For our titles and headings, I chose Montserrat, a wider sans serif typeface inspired by old posters and signs in the Montserrat, Buenos Aires. The boldness of the heavier weights packs good punch, while still giving off a benevolent vibe, making it ideal for posters and emphatic web UI. Like Nunito Sans, it is open source.</p>

      <Figure path="./img/rehack-7.png" caption="Nunito Sans sample."/>
      <Figure path="./img/rehack-8.png" caption="Montserrat sample."/>

      <p>With the basic visual identity established, I went on to broaden the graphical language. Since reverse hackathons are a fairly new concept, I decided to created a series of graphics to represent what Rehack was about. I found that isometry gave me a lot of room for scene setting and storytelling; the resulting isometric graphics were used widely in both our print and digital materials. I also put a light mesh of isoceles triangles as an atomic element that can sit in the background, supporting other graphics without demanding much attention itself. The mesh complements the isometric graphics; it provides order and assists with form, but does not constrain.</p>

      <p>For posters, the team and I decided to design them such that each poster could function by itself, but becomes more powerful in the presence of other Rehack posters. Unfortunately, we didn't get to print them out on full-bleed printers to save money for other event expenses, but they still made a splash around campus.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Procedural generation has been widely used in the fields of game designâ€”developers use this technique to algorithmically create digital assets (3D models, textures, etc.) at large scales while leveraging some computer-generated randomness for more natural scenes. Audioscape uses procedural generation to generate an explorable 3D landscape upon accepting an audio file and alters the landscape based on the audio content. The user has first person controls to "fly" around the scene as it changes. This is an attempt to add a layer of interactivity absent from many other audio visualizers at the time. </p>

        <h3>Scene Generation</h3>
        <p>Our main set of scenes was a cityscape at different times of the day. We used 10,000 unit boxes for buildings and randomly added them to the ground plane, saving each building in a way that can be quickly re-accessed for vertex distortion upon audio input. To texture the buildings, we used a Lambert Material (which uses Gouraud shading). Phong Material actually has better reflection capabilities, which would be especially appealing in our night scene, but Lambert was more efficient for a large number of objects. A special unindended effect of starting the buildings as unit boxes is that they will pop up energetically once the first notes hit.</p>

        <p>The city scene was refined by adding constants that dictated the number of city blocks, width of each block, and size + number of street lamps on the sidewalk. The shade of gray on building was also varied randomly.  The lights on the street lamps were generated separately  from its pole and base so that we could alter the colour based on audio at night.</p>

        <h3>Audio</h3>
        <p>The UI accepts an audio file to analyze and play back. Byte frequency analysis was done using JavaScript's Web Audio API and amplitude analysis was done using p5.js. Upon receiving the byte frequency data, we took a simple approach to estimating treble and bass by splitting the frequencies in two. It was important that this analysis was computationally simple to reduce lag while simultaneously rendering large amounts of geometries and textures. We then took the average of the frequencies in the top and bottom halves, modulated them, and combined them with amplitude data. We used these values to act as parameters in vertex displacement of geometries and pseudo-random colour generation. </p>
